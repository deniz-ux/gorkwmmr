# Background

The Background pages provide context for the different aspects of Panel. In addition to conceptual discussions that aim to deepen users' understanding of this library, the Background may include opinionated reasoning about design decisions, historical development, and technical constrains. While every new user should read through the core concepts that are covered within the [Getting Started material](../getting_started/index.md), this Background section is intended for practitioners to revisit as needed to deepen their understanding of particular topics.
