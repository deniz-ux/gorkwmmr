    "# `SpeechToText` Widget \n",
    "\n",
    "The `SpeechToText` widget controls the speech recognition service of the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*hvhbk3n9SAcI3yS_D1IuXQ.png\" style=\"height: 100px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "It wraps the [HTML5 `SpeechRecognition` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition)\n",
    "\n",
    "The functionality is **experimental** and **only supported by Chrome and a few other browsers**.\n",
    "Checkout https://caniuse.com/speech-recognition or https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition#Browser_compatibility for an up to date list of browsers supporting\n",
    "the SpeechRecognition Api.\n",
    "\n",
    "On some browsers, like Chrome, using Speech Recognition on a web page involves a server-based\n",
    "recognition engine. **Your audio is sent to a web service for recognition processing, so it won't\n",
    "work offline**. Whether this is secure and confidential enough for your use case is up to you\n",
    "to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``lang``** (str): The language of the current SpeechRecognition service in BCP 47 format. For example 'en-US'.\n",
    "* **``continuous``** (bool): Controls whether continuous results are returned for each recognition, or only a single result. Defaults to False.\n",
    "* **``interim_results``** (boolean): Controls whether interim results should be returned (True) or not (False.) Interim results are results that are not yet final (e.g. the RecognitionResult.is_final property is False).\n",
    "* **``max_alternatives``** (int): Sets the maximum number of RecognitionAlternatives provided per result. A number between 1 and 5. The default value is 1.\n",
    "* **``service_uri``** (str): Specifies the location of the speech recognition service used by the current SpeechRecognition service to handle the actual recognition. The default is the user agent's default speech service.\n",
    "* **``grammars``** (GrammarList): A GrammarList object that represents the grammars that will be understood by the current SpeechRecognition service.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``started``** (boolean): Returns True if the Speech Recognition Service is started and False otherwise.\n",
    "* **``audio_started``** (boolean): Returns True if the Audio is started and False otherwise\n",
    "* **``sound_started``** (boolean): Returns True if the Sound is started and False otherwise\n",
    "* **``speech_started``** (boolean): Returns True if the the User has started speaking and False otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``results``** (List\\[RecognitionResult\\]): The results recognized. A list of RecognitionResult objects\n",
    "* **``results_serialized``** (List\\[Dict\\]): The results recognized. A list of Dictionaries.\n",
    "* **``results_last``** (str): What you probably said most recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``button_type``** (str): One of 'default', 'primary', 'success', 'warning', 'danger' and 'light'.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``stop``** (None): Stops the speech recognition service from listening to incoming audio, and attempts to return a list of RecognitionResult using the audio captured so far.\n",
    "* **``abort``** (None): Stops the speech recognition service from listening to incoming audio, and doesn't attempt to return a list of RecognitionResult.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``results_as_html``** (str): Returns the `results` formatted as html. Convenience property for ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grammar\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of words or patterns of words that we want the speech recognition service to recognize.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``src``** (str): A set of words or patterns of words that we want the recognition service to recognize. Defined using JSpeech Grammar Format. See https://www.w3.org/TR/jsgf/.\n",
    "* **``uri``** (str): An uri pointing to the definition. If src is available it will be used. Otherwise uri. The uri will be loaded on the client side only.\n",
    "* **``weight``** (float): The weight of the grammar. A number in the range 0–1. Default is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GrammarList\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of Grammar objects containing words or patterns of words that we want the recognition service to recognize.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``add_from_string``** (src: str, weight: float): Takes a grammar src and weight and adds it to the GrammarList as a new Grammar object. The new Grammar object is returned.\n",
    "* **``add_from_uri``** (uri: str, weight: float): Takes a grammar uri and weight and adds it to the GrammarList as a new Grammar object. The new Grammar object is returned.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **``is_final``** (boolean): A Boolean that states whether this result is final (True) or not (False) — if so, then this is the final time this result will be returned; if not, then this result is an interim result, and may be updated later on.\n",
