    "When building custom applications and dashboards it is frequently useful to extend Panel with custom components, which are specific to a particular application. Panel provides multiple mechanisms to extend and compose diffferent components or even add entirely new components. In this user guide we will go over these approaches and compare the benefits and drawbacks.\n",

    "The simplest way to extend Panel is to implement so called `Viewer` components. These components simply wrap other Panel object and make it possible to compose them as a unit just like any native Panel component. The core mechanism that makes this possible is the implementation of a ``__panel__`` method on the class, which Panel will call when displaying the component.\n",

    "A ReactiveHTML component is declared by providing an HTML template on the `_html` attribute on the class. Parameters are synced by inserting them as template variables of the form `${parameter}`, e.g.:\n",

    "\n",
    "### DOM Events\n",
    "\n",

Any such callback will be given a DOMEvent object as the first and only argument. The DOMEvent contains information about the event on the .data attribute and declares the type of event on the .type attribute.\n",

    "* `state`:  An empty state dictionary which scripts can use to store state for the lifetime of the view.\n",
