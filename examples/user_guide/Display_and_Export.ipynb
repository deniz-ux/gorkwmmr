    "One of the main design goals for Panel was that it should make it possible to seamlessly transition back and forth between interactively prototyping a dashboard in the notebook or on the commandline to deploying it as a standalone server app. This section shows how to display panels interactively, embed static output, save a snapshot, and deploy as a separate web-server app. For more information about deploying Panel apps to various cloud providers see the [Server Deployment](Server_Deployment.ipynb) documentation.\n",

    "As you may have noticed, almost all the Panel documentation is written using notebooks. Panel objects display themselves automatically in a notebook and take advantage of Jupyter Comms to support communication between the rendered app and the Jupyter kernel that backs it on the Python end. To display a Panel object in the notebook is as simple as putting it on the end of a cell. Note, however, that the ``panel.extension`` first has to be loaded to initialize the required JavaScript in the notebook context. In recent versions of JupyterLab this works out of the box but for older versions (`<3.0`) the PyViz labextension has to be installed with:\n",
